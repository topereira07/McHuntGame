Java Game Development (Bootcamp Project) @ Codeforall_

Developed a humorous 2D shooter game in Java within a 10-day timeframe.

This project honed skills in:

Java Fundamentals: Object-oriented programming, game loop development, and core Java syntax.
Game Mechanics: Basic collision detection, player movement, and enemy AI.
Graphics Programming: Creating and manipulating sprites for characters and game elements (optional: if you used libraries like JavaFX or LibGDX).
Teamwork: Collaboration with classmates on code development, design, and testing (mention specific contributions if applicable).
The lighthearted theme poked fun at our master coders, fostering a fun learning environment while solidifying core Java concepts.
